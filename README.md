### 1.Introduction
We introduce a novel multipurpose dataset with over a thousand real-world examples of Persian documents and texts, including categories such as illustrated books, catalogs, newspapers, and scientific articles. The components of these documents are labeled into seven different categories, and the images are accompanied by XML files containing the annotation information. 

### 2. Dataset Description

* Compared to existing datasets, The Arna database can be beneficial not only for tasks such as **OCR**, **layout recognition**, or specifically for **recognizing tables**, **lists**, or **logos**, but it can also be very useful for the overall evaluation of **document analysis systems**.
* Also, One of the notable features of this database is its consideration of various types of text, including **handwritten** and **printed** materials.
* Additionally, this database is classified among multilingual databases, encompassing three languages: **Persian**, **Arabic**, and **English**.
* The dataset also includes accurately annotated files with labeling information for the images. The ground-truth data is organized in XML files containing associated information about the embedded data and image.

The following table summarizes the main features of the Arna dataset.
